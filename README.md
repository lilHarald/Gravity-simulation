# Gravity-simulation
Simple gravity simulation in 2D

Requires Python 3.x and pygame

Settings can be changed by changing the variables at the top of the main.py files.

When two celestial bodies collide, they merge into one.

Clicking on a celestial body shows the current direction it's flying in (white/grey marker), the current resultant force being applied to the body (red marker), and the path it has flown (dots). After running the program and waiting for a few seconds, with the current settings clicking on the big celestial body in the middle will show a beautiful pattern of multiple, colorful paths.
